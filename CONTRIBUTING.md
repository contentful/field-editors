# Contributing to Contentful Field Editors

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Good pull requests, such as patches, improvements, and new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please ask first if somebody else is already working on this or the Contentful developers think your feature is in-scope. Generally always have a related issue with discussions for whatever you are including.

## Folder structure

`@contenful/field-editors` is a monorepo, meaning it is divided into independent sub-packages.
These packages can be found in the `packages/` directory.

In some packages we can find to subdirectories: `component` and `extension`.

- `component` folder contains a code of a field editor which is packaged and used in Contentful web app as `npm` packages.
- `extension` folder contains a UI extension, build with [create-contentful-extension](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-extension) cli, which uses a code from `component` folder. So you can either use build-in editors in your extensions or even fork them, adapt for your needs and install as extensions to your space.

This monorepo is maintained using Lerna. Get started with Lerna by following [this link](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

## Package descriptions

#### [@contentful/field-editor-shared](./packages/_shared)

This package contains shared code (components, utilities, test utilities) that is used by all other field editor packages.

#### [@contentful/field-editor-single-line](./packages/single-line)

This package contains a React `SingleLineEditor` component and an extension that is used as a default for `Short text` field type in the Contentful web application.

#### [@contentful/field-editor-multiple-line](./packages/multiple-line)

This package contains a React `MultipleLineEditor` component and an extension that is used as a default for `Long text` field type in the Contentful web application.

## Local development

### Using `docz`

We use [`docz`](https://www.docz.site/) as a components playground.

```bash
# to run playground in a development mode
yarn docz:dev
```

### Making changes in shared packages

Go to a shared package and run the following command to watch for changes and rebuild the package once it's changed:

```bash
cd packages/_shared
yarn watch
```

### Integration to Contentful web application

_Relevent for Contentful employees only_.

It is convenient to link a local copy of a package to a locally running Contentful web application without publishing a package.

```bash
cd packages/single-line
# register a symplink
yarn link
# watch for changes in the package
yarn watch
```

In the web app repository:

```bash
# create a symlink to a local folder
yarn link '@contentful/field-editor-single-line'
```

## Adding packages

To add another package create a new directory in the `packages` folder. Since we are using Lerna all package scripts are available from the root by running `lerna run <script_name>`.

## Quality & Code Style

### Code formatting

You don't need to worry about formatting your code. It is automatically reformatted using `pretter` on every comming using Git hooks.

### Linting

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Typescript ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) for linting and checking code for errors.

All modern editors should automatically pick up configuration and show errors and warnings while you type.

#### Run ESLint for all packages

```bash
# at the monorepo root
yarn lint
```

### Checking types

#### Run Typescript checker for all packages

```bash
# at the monorepo root
yarn tsc
```

### Tests

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for writing unit tests.

#### Run tests for concrete package

```bash
cd packages/single-line
yarn test
```

#### Run tests for all packages

```bash
# at the monorepo root
yarn test:ci
```
