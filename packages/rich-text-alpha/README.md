This package contains the updated rich text editor, currently in an **ALPHA** state (i.e., not suitable for production use and subject to breaking changes).

This editor extension is built on top of [Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate), a third party framework for building highly customizable rich text editing solutions.
