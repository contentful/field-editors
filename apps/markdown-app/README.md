# Markdown field app

This app demonstrates how you would use `MarkdownEditor` as your own field app.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Contentful App](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Creates or updates your app definition in Contentful, and runs the app in development mode.

Install the app in the Contentful WebApp interface to be able to add and view it in the Content Model interface.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
