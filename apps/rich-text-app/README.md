# RichText field app

This app demonstrates how you would use `RichTextEditor` as your own field app.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Contentful App](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Creates or updates your app definition in Contentful, and runs the app in development mode.

Install the app in the Contentful WebApp interface to be able to add and view it in the Content Model interface.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `yarn upload`

Uploads the build folder to contentful and creates a bundle that is automatically activated.
The command guides you through the deployment process and asks for all required arguments.
Read [here](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/create-contentful-app/#deploy-with-contentful) for more information about the deployment process.

#### `yarn upload-ci`

Similar to `yarn upload` it will upload your app to contentful and activate it. The only difference is   
that with this command all required arguments are read from the environment variables, for example when you add
the upload command to your CI pipeline.

For this command to work, the following environment variables must be set: 

- `CONTENTFUL_ORG_ID` - The ID of your organization
- `CONTENTFUL_APP_DEF_ID` - The ID of the app to which to add the bundle
- `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - A personal [access token](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/personal-access-tokens)

## Libraries to use
