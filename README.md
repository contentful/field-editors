# @contentful/field-editors

[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lernajs.io/)

This is the monorepo for all field editors and apps by [Contentful][contentful].

Since these are developed using the [App SDK][app-sdk], this will allow you to understand how each editor works, fork existing apps or create your own apps based on existing Contentful components' source rather than starting from scratch.

It uses [Typescript][typescript], [React][react], [Forma36][forma36] (a design system & component library by Contentful) and is managed using [Lerna][lerna]. Code is automatically formatted with [Prettier][prettier] and checked with [ESLint][eslint] on every commit using Git hooks.

## Available field editors

Playground with all components: [https://contentful-field-editors.netlify.app/](https://contentful-field-editors.netlify.app/)

This repository has all editorial components that you can find in the Contentful Web application.
You can run each of these component as a custom field app or compose them into a custom entry app.
You could also use these components as the basis for a custom [Contentful App](https://www.contentful.com/app-framework/)

- Single line editor
- Multi line editor
- Dropdown
- Tags
- List
- Checkbox
- Radio
- Boolean
- Rating
- Number
- Url
- JSON
- Location
- Date
- Markdown
- Slug
- Entry reference / Media
- Rich Text

Also this repository contains shared packages that simplify development and testing of field and entry apps.

Feel free to reach out to us with the ones that'd be the most useful to have
here by filing a [Github issue][github-issues]!

### Styles

To achieve the same field editor look as in the Contentful UI, you need to render `GlobalStyled` component.

```jsx
import { GlobalStyles } from '@contentful/f36-components';

function Root() {
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyles />
      <MyApp />
    </>
  );
}
```
